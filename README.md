# faros

faros (pronounced /faros/, or /fa…πos/) is a simple command line TODO list manager written in Rust, meant to encourage users to create SMART goals, and to complete them in a timely manner.

## Features

* Tasks are elegantly organized as a tree, enabling you to create arbitrarily complex networks of subtasks.
* `faros list` is available to automatically make a short TODO list from your tree of tasks.
* Tasks can be given high, medium, or low priority, enabling you to filter through your tasks by importance.
* It's awesome. I'll write more about how it's awesome later.

## TODO

* Tags will be implemented, allowing you to group together tasks of a similar type.
